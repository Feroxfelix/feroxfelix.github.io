I decided to try out Joplin as a markdown editor to see wether or not it suits my needs for writing instruction and documenting my projects.

Actually I am writing this blog post, as I document the same blogpost!

I have installed Joplin Desktop for Ubuntu through **'Ubuntu Software'**, by just opening up software and searching for Joplin:

<img src="/resources/8c4a4e7cf172561737fbad933c0d3dc9.png">

There are 4 column of Joplin.

**Notebooks** 	

**Notes** 	

**Editor**		

**Visual representation**

Now it will be exciting to see how I can bring in the pictures for my posts :)

After some testing, I found that Jekyll ignores files that start with underscore.
Making them invisible after rendering.

**I tried following 4 ways of implementing pictures:**

<img src="/resources/8737e6c6849047739f503cc3bcb9c9d6.png">


**And found that they will be interpreted as:**



<img src="/resources/87c0a9f6956d4d07a16f281ab79adc26.png">

So as you can see, in the example, only when referencing the image in the /resources/ directory, pictures are displayed...

Now I can begin blogging !!!
